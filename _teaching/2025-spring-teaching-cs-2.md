# Short Description

This intermediate computer technologies course focuses on artificial intelligence, and concepts of rational agent and work environment. The aim is to develop students’ skills in problem-solving search and optimization through the application of classic artificial intelligence algorithms. Prior knowledge is required of discrete mathematics, as well as intermediate programming skills in general-purpose languages. Learning outcome: Students analyze and characterize simple work environments in which they can apply one of the problem-solving search algorithms studied during the course.

# Course objective
Upon completion of this educational unit, students will be able to:

- Identify and design efficient algorithms to solve optimization problems.
- Use machine learning methods and artificial intelligence in information processing to enable process, service, or product personalization.
- Design and program efficient algorithms.
