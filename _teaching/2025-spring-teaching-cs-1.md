Title: Modeling Learning with Artificial Intelligence (Modelaci√≥n del aprendizaje con inteligencia artificial)
======

CIP: 270301
Clave: TC2034

Short Description: It is an intermediate-level course in computational technologies, focusing on basic algorithms and the development of recommendation systems and analysis using algorithms such as K-means, neural networks, and SVM, among others. It requires prior knowledge of intelligent agents, discrete mathematics, and programming skills to understand and fulfill the course requirements. As a learning outcome, the student analyzes and models simple problem situations through the application of artificial intelligence algorithms.

# Course objective
Upon completion of this educational unit, students will be able to:
- Identify and design efficient algorithms to solve optimization problems.
- Use machine learning methods and artificial intelligence in information processing to enable process, service, or product personalization.
- Analyze the digital environment as a new culture with awareness of exchange and collaboration networks, the new materialities, sensitivities and cognitive schemes that comprise them, and their impact on the construction of a political and cultural life in the network society.
- Assess the different technological systems and devices, being open to the search and creative implementation of relevant alternatives for their professional performance and the transformation of their professional practice.
