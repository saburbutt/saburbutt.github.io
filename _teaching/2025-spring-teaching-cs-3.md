# Short Description

I taught both Module 1 and Module 2 of the training block titled “Development of Advanced Applications in Computer Science” (Group 504). Module 1 focused on Research Methodology, where students learned about the overall structure of an investigation, strategies for reading and selecting relevant academic articles, and the preparation of a comprehensive state of the art. They also explored how to measure results effectively, interpret and compare findings, and present their conclusions through clear and well-structured reports. Module 2 covered Artificial Intelligence, beginning with core concepts of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, followed by hands-on practice with neural networks and data visualization techniques. The module concluded with advanced topics such as deep learning and convolutional networks, providing students with both theoretical foundations and applied skills to develop intelligent computational solutions.

# Course objective
At the end of the training unit, the student:

- Implements computational algorithms that solve problems.
- Optimizes computational algorithms used in the development of solutions.
- Creates computational models for problem-solving.
- Implements computational models in the numerical solution of a problem.
