I am a Research Professor at the [Institute for the Future of Education (IFE)](https://tec.mx/en/ife), Tecnológico de Monterrey, where my work focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its applications in educational assessment, feedback, and pedagogical innovation. Alongside my research, I teach in the [Department of Computer Science](https://research.tec.mx/vivo-tec/display/PID_501619) at Tecnológico de Monterrey, where I share my expertise in NLP, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) with students. I also lead the development of computational methods for the [ShapingSkills](https://shapingskills.mx/) project, designing models for dynamic skill identification and semantic understanding to support personalized learning and workforce development. 

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Living Lab and Data Hub (LL&DH)](https://ifelldh.tec.mx/en), Institute for the Future of Education (IFE), where I worked on advanced NLP methods for educational technology. I earned my Ph.D. and M.Sc. in Computer Science, cum laude, from the Centro de Investigación en Computación, Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN), and my bachelor’s degree from Forman Christian University in Lahore, where I specialized in Software Engineering and Computer Science.

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, traveling, and exploring the art of brewing tea.
