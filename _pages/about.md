I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Institute for the Future of Education (IFE)](https://tec.mx/en/ife), Tecnológico de Monterrey, Mexico. In this role, I lead interdisciplinary projects that bridge the fields of Natural Language Processing and Education. Alongside my research, I also teach at Tecnológico de Monterrey, where I share my expertise in NLP, machine learning, and artificial intelligence with students.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [Centro de Investigación en Computación](http://www.cic.ipn.mx/index.php/es/), Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN). My doctoral research focused on “Automatic Personality and Behavior Detection in Texts Using Deep Learning,” under the mentorship of [Dr. Alexander Gelbukh](https://www.gelbukh.com/) and [Dr. Grigori Sidorov](http://www.cic.ipn.mx/~sidorov/). I also hold a master’s degree with honors in Computer Science from the same institution and completed my bachelor’s degree at [Forman Christian University](https://www.fccollege.edu.pk/) in Lahore, where I specialized in Software Engineering and Computer Sciences.

My expertise lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP), with research interests that include Personality and Emotion Detection, Low-Resource Languages, and Small Language Models (SLMs). I’m passionate about using machine and deep learning techniques to develop computational solutions that offer deeper insights into human behavior.

Outside of work, I enjoy working out, cooking, traveling, and reading. I have a particular passion for tea—I love exploring its diverse flavors and the subtle art of brewing the perfect cup. If you ever find yourself in my company, I’d be more than happy to invite you for a cup of tea and a great conversation.
