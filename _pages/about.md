I am a Research Professor (Profesor Investigador) at the [Institute for the Future of Education (IFE)](https://tec.mx/en/ife), Tecnológico de Monterrey, where my work focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its applications in educational assessment, feedback, and pedagogical innovation. I also lead the development of computational methods for the [ShapingSkills](https://shapingskills.mx/) project, designing models for dynamic skill identification and semantic understanding to support personalized learning and workforce development. My current research interests include Small Language Models (SLMs), low-resource languages, complex emotion detection, and the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in education. Alongside my research, I teach in the [Department of Computer Science](https://research.tec.mx/vivo-tec/display/PID_501619) at Tecnológico de Monterrey, where I share my expertise in NLP, machine learning, and artificial intelligence with students.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Living Lab and Data Hub (LL&DH)](https://ifelldh.tec.mx/en), Institute for the Future of Education (IFE), where I worked with Dr. Héctor Ceballos on advanced NLP methods for educational technology. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [Centro de Investigación en Computación](http://www.cic.ipn.mx/index.php/es/), Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN) under the mentorship of [Dr. Alexander Gelbukh](https://www.gelbukh.com/) and [Dr. Grigori Sidorov](http://www.cic.ipn.mx/~sidorov/). I also hold a master’s degree with honors in Computer Science from the same institution and completed my bachelor’s degree at [Forman Christian University](https://www.fccollege.edu.pk/) in Lahore, where I specialized in Software Engineering and Computer Sciences.

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, traveling, and reading. I have a particular passion for tea—I love exploring its diverse flavors and the subtle art of brewing the perfect cup. If you ever find yourself in my company, I’d be more than happy to invite you for a cup of tea and a great conversation.
