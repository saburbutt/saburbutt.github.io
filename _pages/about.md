I currently serve as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Institute for the Future of Education (IFE)](https://tec.mx/en/ife), Tecnológico de Monterrey, Mexico. My role at IFE is centered around leading interdisciplinary projects that explore the convergence of Natural Language Processing and Education.

I earned my Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Computer Science from the [Centro de Investigación en Computación](http://www.cic.ipn.mx/index.php/es/), Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN). My doctoral research focused on "Automatic Personality and Behavior Detection in Texts Using Deep Learning" under the guidance of [Dr. Alexander Gelbukh](https://www.gelbukh.com/) and [Dr. Grigori Sidorov](http://www.cic.ipn.mx/~sidorov/). I hold a master's degree with honors in Computer Science from the [Centro de Investigación en Computación](http://www.cic.ipn.mx/index.php/es/), Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN). Additionally, I earned a bachelor's degree from [Forman Christian University](https://www.fccollege.edu.pk/) in Lahore, with a double specialization in Software Engineering and Computer Sciences.

My expertise lies in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), and my broad research interests encompass areas such as Personality and Emotion Detection, Low Resource Languages, and Question Answering. I am dedicated to leveraging machine and deep learning techniques to develop computing solutions that provide deeper insights into human behavior.

In my free time, I love to work out, cook, travel, and read. I'm particularly passionate about tea, savoring its diverse flavors and the art of brewing the perfect cup. If you ever find yourself in my company, I'd be delighted to invite you for a cup of tea and some great conversation.
